# dlitsim
**DLITSim** is a Python tool to simulate Dark Lock-In Thermography (DLIT) results based on numerical sheet resistance networks in multilayer systems (e.g., ITO and Carbon layers in optoelectronic devices). It solves the discretized Kirchhoff equations over a grid to extract local power dissipation maps.
